# Ultimate Steel Design Workflow (AS 4100) – EGB376

This repository contains a **decision-based, step-by-step steel design workflow** developed for **EGB376 – Steel Structures**.  
It is designed specifically for **open-book assessments** and aims to guide students through steel design problems in a **clear, structured, and exam-safe way**.

This is **not just formula notes** — it is a *problem-solving system* that helps you decide:
- what checks are required,
- in what order to do them,
- and how to present answers clearly for marks.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Document

This workflow was created to help students:
- Avoid missing critical checks (LTB, buckling, net section, interaction, etc.)
- Interpret exam questions quickly and correctly
- Structure answers in a way markers expect
- Reduce cognitive load under time pressure

It is especially useful for:
- Open-book exams
- Take-home exams
- Revision and concept consolidation
- Learning how **real steel design workflows** operate

## 🧠 How to Use This Properly (IMPORTANT)

⚠️ **This is not a shortcut or a substitute for understanding.**

To get value from this document:
1. **Learn the theory first** (lectures + tutorials)
2. Use this workflow to:
   - guide your thinking,
   - check you haven’t missed anything,
   - structure your solution logically
3. Follow the decision points — do not jump straight to formulas

👉 If you blindly plug numbers into boxes without understanding *why*, you will struggle when questions vary.

## 📂 What’s Inside

The document is organised into workflows based on **primary structural action**:

- **Load Analysis & Combinations**
- **Tension Members**
- **Compression Members (Columns)**
- **Beams (Bending, Shear, LTB, Web Bearing)**
- **Beam–Columns (Combined Actions)**
- **Bolted Connections**
- **Welded Connections (including eccentric weld groups)**

Each workflow includes:
- Decision trees
- “DO THIS NOW” prompts
- Common traps and warnings
- Exam-safe simplifications (clearly labelled)
- Final answer templates

## 📐 Standards & Scope

- Based primarily on **AS 4100** and **AS/NZS 1170**
- Intended for **EGB376-level problems**
- Uses **simplified expressions** where commonly taught in the course  
  (explicitly flagged — always follow the exam question wording)

⚠️ This is **not** a substitute for the standard in professional practice.
